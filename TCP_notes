TCP/IP
	> A set of multiplie protocols


IP
	- IP is the protocol within TCP/IP that controls routing of information to 
	  different computers and servers on the network.

	- deals with IP addresses, default gateway, subnet masking.

	- It allows two computers to find each other on
	  the network so they can communicate with each other.
	 
	- Is a "routable" protocol, which means you can divide networks into multiple
	  subnetworks. In non-routable protocals, every computer can talk to each other
	  which can cause havok.
	 
	- OSI model is the model for how network communications happen. IP is on
	  layer 3, the network layer.


TCP
	 - "Transmission Control Protocol" is what allows computers on a network to
	   actually talk.
